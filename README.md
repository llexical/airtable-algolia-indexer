# airtable-algolia-indexer
**DEPRECATED: We no longer use Algolia in our stack due to how expensive it was to run.**

So we need to index all airtable records into algolia, this is what this does.

## Getting Started
- Download this repo :D
- `npm i`
- Fill in environment variables (you can set up free trials of both airtable and algolia)
- `npm start`
